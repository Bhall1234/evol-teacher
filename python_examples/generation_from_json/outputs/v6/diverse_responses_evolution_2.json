Consider using factorial to determine how many different ways you can distribute the candies if each child gets at least one candy. Please provide an example of what you did with a piece of code that shows how to calculate the factorial of 5 candies in a way that is easy to understand for a beginner Python student."

Create a variable called `number` and assign it to the input number from the user.\n2. Use the modulo operator `%` to check if the number is divisible by 2, i.e., `(number % 2) == 0`. If this condition is true, then the number is even. Otherwise, it is odd.\n3. Print out \"even\" or \"odd\" depending on whether the number is even or odd."

        "instruction": "To sort a list of integer numbers in descending order using loops and list operations, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list to store the sorted numbers.\n2. Loop through each number in the original list and compare it to the next number. If the current number is greater than the next number, swap them.\n3. After comparing all numbers with the next number, append the largest number to the end of the sorted list.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all numbers have been compared and swapped, then append the last number to the sorted list.\n5. Return the sorted list.\n\nHere is some sample code that implements this method:\n```\ndef sort_descending(numbers):\n    sorted_list = []\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        largest = None\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):\n            if numbers[i] > numbers[j]:\n                swap(numbers, i, j)\n        append(sorted_list, largest)\n    return sorted_list\n```\nThis code uses a function called `swap` to swap two elements in the list, and an `append` function to add an element to the end of the list. You can use these functions as a starting point and modify them to suit your needs."

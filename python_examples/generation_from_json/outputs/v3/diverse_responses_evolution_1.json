        "instruction": "Calculate the Total Cost of Insurance Premiums\n\nAs an insurance agent, you need to calculate the total cost of premiums for a customer's policy. The premium calculation formula involves multiplying the base rate by the number of years, and then applying the factorial function to the result. Write a Python function that takes two arguments: the base rate (a float) and the number of years (an integer). The function should return the total cost of premiums as a float.\n\nFor example, if the base rate is 100 and the number of years is 3, the output would be the product of the factorial of 3 multiplied by 100.",

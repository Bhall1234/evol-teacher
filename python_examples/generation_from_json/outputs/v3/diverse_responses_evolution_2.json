        "instruction": "Calculate the Total Cost of Insurance Premiums\nAs an insurance agent, you need to calculate the total cost of premiums for a customer's policy. The premium calculation formula involves multiplying the base rate by the number of years. Write a Python function that takes two arguments: the base rate (a float) and the number of years (an integer). The function should use a loop to multiply the base rate by the number of years, then return the result.\n\nFor example, if the base rate is 100 and the number of years is 3, the output would be the product of the base rate and the number of years.",

For example, if your list contains the numbers [4, 2, 9, 7, 1], how would you arrange them so that the largest number comes first and the smallest number comes last?",

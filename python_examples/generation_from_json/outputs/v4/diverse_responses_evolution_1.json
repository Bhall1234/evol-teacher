Here is an example:\n```python\nnumbers = [10, 5, 8, 2, 6, 9]\nsorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)\nprint(sorted_numbers) # Output: [10, 9, 8, 6, 5, 2]\n```\nYou can also use the `reverse()` method of a list to achieve the same result. Here is an example:\n```python\nnumbers = [10, 5, 8, 2, 6, 9]\nsorted_numbers = numbers.reverse()\nprint(sorted_numbers) # Output: [10, 9, 8, 6, 5, 2]\n```\nBoth of these methods will sort the list in descending order based on the integer values of each element."

        "instruction": "Write a Python function to find the factorial of a given positive integer using real-world context. For example, if the input is 5, then the output should be 120 (5!).",
        "answer": "Explanation:\nThe question asks for a Python function that takes in a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is the product of that number and all the numbers below it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 120 (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1).\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```\ndef find_factorial(n):\n    return n * (n - 1) / 2\n```\nThis code appears to be an attempt to calculate the factorial using a formula for the sum of a series, but it is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the numbers below `n` must also be multiplied together. Additionally, this formula only works for even numbers and would produce incorrect results for odd numbers.\n\nPrompt:\nSpot the problem in the code. What is wrong with the formula used to calculate the factorial?"

        "instruction": "Write a Python code to determine if a given number is even or odd by using the modulo operator (%).",
        "answer": "Explanation:\nThe modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of dividing two numbers. In this case, we want to check if a number is even or odd by checking if it is divisible by 2. If a number is not divisible by 2, then it is an odd number.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```\ndef is_even_or_odd(n):\n    return n % 2 == 0\n```\nThis code checks whether the input number `n` is even by checking if it is divisible by 2 and returning `True` or `False`. However, it does not account for numbers that are odd. To fix this issue, we can add an additional check to determine whether a number is odd:\n```\ndef is_even_or_odd(n):\n    return n % 2 == 0 or n % 2 == 1\n```\nPrompt:\nSpot the problem in the code. What happens if you input a negative number?"

        "instruction": "Sorting a list of integers in descending order can be achieved using the built-in `sorted()` function with the `reverse` argument set to `True`. Here's an example:\n```python\nnumbers = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]\nsorted_descending = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)\nprint(sorted_descending) # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n```",
        "answer": "Explanation:\nThe `sorted()` function takes a list of integers and sorts them in ascending order. To sort the list in descending order, we need to set the `reverse` argument to `True`. However, in the code provided, the `reverse` argument is not used at all. Therefore, the sorted list will be in ascending order instead of descending order.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```python\nnumbers = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]\nsorted_descending = sorted(numbers)\nprint(sorted_descending) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem in the code? Why is the list not sorted in descending order as expected?"

        "answer": "Explanation:\nThe problem in the code is that it is using the `float()` function with a string as an argument, which is not allowed. The correct usage of the `float()` function is to use a number or numeric literal, such as `3.14`, instead of a string.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```\nmy_string = \"3.14\"\nmy_float = float(my_string) # output: 3.14\n```\nPrompt:\nSpot the problem in the code and explain why it is incorrect."

        "instruction": "1. How to create a custom exception in Python?\nPlease provide an example of how to write code using try/except blocks that throws a custom exception in Python.",
        "answer": "Explanation:\nCustom exceptions are user-defined exceptions in Python that can be used to catch and handle specific errors or issues in your program. To create a custom exception, you need to define a new class that inherits from the built-in Exception class. The new class should have an error message that describes the issue that caused the exception.\n\nHere is an example of how to write code using try/except blocks that throws a custom exception in Python:\n```\nclass CustomException(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, error_message):\n        self.error_message = error_message\n        \ndef divide(a, b):\n    try:\n        return a / b\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        raise CustomException(\"Cannot divide by zero\") from e\n```\nIn this example, the `CustomException` class is defined with an `__init__` method that takes in an error message. The `divide` function is defined to use try/except blocks to catch a `ZeroDivisionError` exception and raise a `CustomException` instead. When the `CustomException` is raised, it will include the error message specified in the `__init__` method.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```\nclass CustomException(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, error_message):\n        self.error_message = error_message\n        \ndef divide(a, b):\n    try:\n        return a / b\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        raise CustomException(\"Cannot divide by zero\") from e\n```\nPrompt:\nSpot the problem in the code. What is the issue that is being caused by the custom exception?"

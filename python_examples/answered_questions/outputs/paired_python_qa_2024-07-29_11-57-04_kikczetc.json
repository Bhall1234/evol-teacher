The rule for determining if a number is even or odd is that it is even if the number ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, and it is odd otherwise.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n\n```python\ndef is_even(n):\n    return n % 2 == 1\n```\n\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem with this code?"

In Python, the basic syntax for a for loop looks like this:\n```\nfor variable in iterable:\n    # do something with variable\n```\nIn this example, `variable` is a placeholder that represents each item in the `iterable`, which can be any sequence type such as a list or tuple. The loop will iterate over each item in the `iterable`, and execute the code inside the loop body for each item.\n\nIn the case of the question, we are asked to print out the items in a list of fruits using a for loop. However, the provided incorrect code is missing the `in` keyword, which is essential for creating a proper for loop.\n\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem with the code?

In this question, we are asked to determine if a given number is even or odd by using the modulo operator. The problem with this question is that it does not provide enough information for the user to understand how to use the modulo operator to solve the problem.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```\nnum = 10\nif num % 2 == 0:\n    print(\"Even\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Odd\")\n```\nThis code is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the modulo operator returns a remainder, and not a boolean value. The correct way to use the modulo operator to determine if a number is even or odd is to check if the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is equal to 0.\n\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem in the code?"

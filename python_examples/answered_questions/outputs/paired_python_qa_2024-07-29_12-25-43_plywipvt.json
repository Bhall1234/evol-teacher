        "output": "Explanation:\nIn Python, a custom exception is a way to define your own error messages and exceptions that can be raised when certain conditions are met in your code. This allows you to create more specific and meaningful error messages that can help users understand what went wrong and how to fix the issue.\n\nTo create a custom exception in Python, you need to define a new class that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class. Here's an example:\n```python\nclass CustomException(Exception):\n    pass\n```\nNow, you can raise this custom exception whenever you want by using the `raise` keyword followed by the name of your custom exception and any additional information you want to include in the error message. For example:\n```python\ntry:\n    # Some code that might cause an error\nexcept CustomException as e:\n    print(e)\n```\nIncorrect Code:\nHere's some incorrect code that a beginner might write when trying to create a custom exception:\n```python\nclass CustomException:\n    def __init__(self, message):\n        self.message = message\n\ntry:\n    # Some code that might cause an error\nexcept CustomException as e:\n    print(e)\n```\nThis code defines a class called `CustomException` that has an `__init__` method that takes a `message` parameter. However, this is not the correct way to define a custom exception in Python. The `Exception` class should be inherited from and the `__init__` method should take no parameters. Additionally, the `except` block should catch the specific type of exception you want to handle, rather than just catching all exceptions.\n\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem with the incorrect code?"

The `in` keyword should be used to specify the iterable being looped over, and the variable name should be assigned to each item in the list as it is looped over. Additionally, the indentation of the print statement is incorrect, which will cause an error when the code is run.\n\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem with the for loop?"

This is because the variable `result` is being initialized with a value of `1`, and then the loop iterates over the numbers from `0` to `n-1`, multiplying each number by `result`. However, since `result` is always equal to `1`, the product will always be `1`, regardless of the input.\n\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem in this code?"

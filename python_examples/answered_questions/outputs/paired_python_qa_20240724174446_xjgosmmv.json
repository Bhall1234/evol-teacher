This can be achieved by using a loop (such as a for loop or while loop) to iterate over the range of numbers and print each number.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```\nprint(\"1\" + \"2\" + ... + \"10\")\n```\nPrompt:\n\nWhat is wrong with this code? Is there a logical error, or an error in syntax? Can you fix it to correctly print the numbers from 1 to 10?"

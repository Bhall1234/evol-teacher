        "output": "Explanation:\nThe modulo operator (%) is used to determine the remainder of a division operation. In this question, we are asked to determine if a given number is even or odd by using the modulo operator. The basic concept behind this question is that an even number will always have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, while an odd number will always have a remainder of 1.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```python\ndef is_even(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\nThis code has a logical error and does not work as intended. The problem with this code is that it always returns `False`, regardless of the input number. This is because the `else` clause is only executed when the condition `n % 2 == 0` is false, but in this case, it will always be true since we are checking if the remainder is 0.\n\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem in the code?"

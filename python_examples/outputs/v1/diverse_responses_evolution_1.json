The total number of books on the bookshelf is `factorial(m)` times the number of books on the first shelf, which is `m`. For example, if there are `3! = 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 6` rows of books on a shelf, and each row has `4` books, then there are `6 \u00d7 4 = 24` books on the bookshelf in total.\n\nWrite a Python function to calculate the number of books on a bookshelf with `n` shelves, where each shelf contains `m` books. The function should take two arguments: `m`, the number of books per shelf, and `n`, the number of shelves.",

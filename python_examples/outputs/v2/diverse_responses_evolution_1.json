Write a Python function that calculates the total number of ways to arrange these boxes.\n\nNote: The factorial of a given number n (denoted as `n!`) is used to calculate the total number of permutations, which in this case represents the total number of ways to arrange the boxes. Your function should be able to calculate `n!` and then use it to determine the total number of arrangements.\n\nExample:\n```\nInput: n = 5, k = 3\nOutput: 720 (calculated using the formula 5! / (3!(5-3)!))\n```",

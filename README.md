# Evol-Teacher

This repo implements the code generation instruction process described in the WizardCoder paper. This process utilizes EvolInstruct iterations first described in the WizardLM paper. WizardCoder is currently the state of the art open source code generation model, and only behind GPT-4 in closed source models.

I was able to create EvolInstruct-Code-8k which was seeded with the Code-Alpaca-2k dataset. The full EvolInstruct-Code-80k as used in the paper is currently being processed.

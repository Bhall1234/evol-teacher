This is incorrect because JavaScript has lexical scoping rules, which means that variables declared in the global scope are not accessible within inner scopes (like loops). By doing so, we will get an \"Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined\" error.\n\nTo fix this mistake, I would declare the `i` variable within the loop using `let` or `var`, for example:\n\n```\nfor(let i = 0; i < numbersArray.length; i++) {\n    console.log(numbersArray[i])\n}\n```"

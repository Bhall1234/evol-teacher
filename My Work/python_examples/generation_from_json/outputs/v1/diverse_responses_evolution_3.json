Your mission is to craft a Python program that helps determine whether a customer's order total is even or odd, while also calculating the total sales tax for their purchase. To get started, write a code that accepts two integers as input - the order total and the tax rate - and then outputs a clear message stating \"Even\" if the order total can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder, or \"Odd\" otherwise. Don't forget to include the calculated total amount of sales tax in your output!",

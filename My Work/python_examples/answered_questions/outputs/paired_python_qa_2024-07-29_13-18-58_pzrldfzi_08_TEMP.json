        "output": "Explanation:\nThe modulo operator (%) is used to determine the remainder of a division operation. In Python, it can be used to check if a number is even or odd by dividing it by 2 and checking the remainder. However, there are some common mistakes that beginners make when using the modulo operator in this way.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```python\ndef is_even(n):\n    return n % 2 == 0\n```\nThis code looks correct at first glance, but it has a subtle bug. The problem is that if `n` is an even number, the modulo operator will return 0, which is considered false in Python. Therefore, this function will return False for all even numbers, making it impossible to determine whether a given number is odd or even.\n\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem in the code? Try running it with some test cases and see if you can figure out why it's not working as intended."

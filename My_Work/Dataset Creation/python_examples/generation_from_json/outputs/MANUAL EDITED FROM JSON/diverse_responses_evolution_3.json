In Python, there are several types of loops, including the for loop and the while loop. The for loop is used when you know how many iterations you want to perform, while the while loop is used when you don't know how many iterations you want to perform.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```python\nfor i in range(5):\nprint(\"Hello\")\n```\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem in this code?

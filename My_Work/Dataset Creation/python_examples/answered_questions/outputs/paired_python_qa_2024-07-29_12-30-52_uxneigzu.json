        "instruction": "1. How to create a custom exception in Python?\nPlease provide an example of how to write code using try/except blocks that throws a custom exception in Python.",
        "output": "Explanation:\nIn Python, a custom exception is a way to create a new type of error or exception that can be raised and caught by your program. This allows you to handle specific types of errors in a more targeted manner than the built-in exceptions provided by Python.\n\nTo create a custom exception in Python, you need to define a new class that inherits from the `Exception` class. The name of this class should be descriptive and indicate what type of error it represents. For example, if you want to create an exception for a file not found error, you might call your class `FileNotFoundError`.\n\nHere's an example of how to define a custom exception in Python:\n```python\nclass FileNotFoundError(Exception):\n    pass\n```\nNow that we have defined our custom exception, we can use it in our code. Let's say we want to write a function that reads a file and returns its contents. If the file is not found, we want to raise an error with a descriptive message. Here's how we might do this:\n```python\ndef read_file(filename):\n    try:\n        with open(filename, \"r\") as f:\n            return f.read()\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        raise FileNotFoundError(\"File not found: {}\".format(filename))\n```\nIn this example, we define a `try` block that tries to read the file using the `open()` function. If the file is not found, an exception of type `FileNotFoundError` will be raised. We catch this exception and raise our own custom exception with a descriptive message.\n\nNow let's try some incorrect code:\n```python\ndef read_file(filename):\n    try:\n        with open(filename, \"r\") as f:\n            return f.read()\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        raise Exception(\"File not found: {}\".format(filename))\n```\nThis code is incorrect because it catches the `FileNotFoundError` exception and raises a generic `Exception` instead of our custom `FileNotFoundError`. This means that the error message will be less descriptive and harder to debug.\n\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem in this code?"

The `for` keyword should be followed by the variable name that will represent each item in the list, and then the list itself. In this case, the variable name should be `fruit`, since we want to iterate over each fruit in the list.\n\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem with the code?"

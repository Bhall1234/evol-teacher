        "instruction": "Write a Python code to determine if a given number is even or odd by using the modulo operator (%).",
        "answer": "Explanation:\nThe modulo operator (%) is used to get the remainder of a division operation. It returns the result of the division when the dividend is divided by the divisor. For example, 17 % 5 = 2 because 17 / 5 = 3 with a remainder of 2.\n\nIn this problem, we are given a number and we need to determine if it is even or odd using the modulo operator. The idea behind this approach is that if a number is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder, then it is an even number. Otherwise, it is an odd number.\n\nFor example, if we have the number 14 and we use the modulo operator to check if it is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder, we get:\n\n14 % 2 = 0\n\nSince the result of this operation is 0, we know that 14 is an even number. If the result were any other value, such as 1 or -1, then 14 would be an odd number.\n\nIncorrect Code:\nHere's some incorrect code that a beginner might write to solve this problem:\n```\ndef determine_even_odd(number):\n    if number % 2 == 0:\n        return \"Even\"\n    else:\n        return \"Odd\"\n```\nPrompt:\nCan you identify the problem with the code?

        "answer": "Explanation:\nTo create a custom exception in Python, you can define a new class that inherits from the built-in Exception class. This new class should have a unique name that describes the type of error that your custom exception represents. For example, if you want to create a custom exception for when a file is not found, you could define a new class called \"FileNotFoundError\".\n\nHere's an example of how you might write code using try/except blocks that throws a custom exception in Python:\n```\ntry:\n    with open(\"myfile.txt\") as f:\n        data = f.read()\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found!\")\n```\nIn this example, the `with` statement is used to open a file called \"myfile.txt\". If the file does not exist, an exception of type `FileNotFoundError` will be raised. This exception is caught using the `except` block and the user is prompted to enter a new file name.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```\ntry:\n    with open(\"myfile.txt\") as f:\n        data = f.read()\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found!\")\n    raise IOError(\"Invalid file path.\")\n```\nThis code is incorrect because it raises a new exception of type `IOError` instead of the custom exception that was originally raised. This could be confusing for the user, as they may expect to see the error message \"File not found!\" if the file does not exist. Additionally, the `IOError` exception is not specific to the issue at hand and does not provide any useful information about why the file could not be opened.\n\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem in this code? How might you fix it to create a custom exception that is more helpful for the user?"

        "instruction": "Please create a for loop in Python to print out the items in the following list of fruits: [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\"].",
        "answer": "Explanation:\nThe goal of this question is for you to create a for loop to print out the items in a list of fruits. The first step would be to create the list of fruits, which can be done using square brackets `[]` and putting each fruit in quotations. Next, you would need to create a for loop that iterates through each item in the list and prints it out.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\"]\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\nprint(\"The end\")\n```\nThis code is incorrect for a few reasons. First, the `for` loop doesn't have an indentation before it, which is necessary to indicate that it is part of the `for` loop. Second, there is no need to use the word `in` in the loop, as it is implied by the fact that you are iterating through each item in the list. Finally, the `print(\"The end\")` statement is outside of the for loop, which means it will only be executed once, after all the items have been printed out.\n\nPrompt:\nSpot the problem in the code and suggest how to fix it by adding an indentation before the `for` loop, removing the word `in`, and moving the `print(\"The end\")` statement inside of the for loop."

First, it only checks for the comma character, but there are many other punctuation characters that we need to check for. Second, it prints a message regardless of whether or not the string contains a punctuation character, which is not what we want.

            "A `for` loop is a control flow statement in Python used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range). Here's a simple example:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n```\n\nHere is how it works:\n\n- `for`: This is the keyword for starting a `for` loop.\n\n- `i`: This is the iterator variable. It's the loop variable that is repeatedly used within the loop.\n\n- `in range(5)`: This is the range(start, stop, step) function. It generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to, but not including, the specified stop value. The step argument is optional and defaults to 1.\n\n- `print(i)`: This is the code inside the loop.\n\nSo the loop starts executing, and for each iteration (or \"execution\"), it uses `i` to print the current value of `i`. The loop then increments `i` by 1 and starts the loop again. This process continues until `i` has reached its final value in the range, at which point the loop ends.\n\nPlease note that the `range` function's stop value is exclusive, meaning it does not include the final value.\n\nHere's how you can modify the above example to print the numbers in a list:\n\n```python\nlist_items = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\nfor i in list_items:\n    print(i)\n```\n\nIn this case, `i` is going through each item in the `list_items` list.\n\nAlso note that while the `range(5)` function is useful when you know in advance how many times you want to loop, you can also use `for` loops with a `while` loop when you don't know how many iterations you'll need to do."

For each iteration, the value of `i` (current number) is printed.\n\nHere's an example with a list:\n\n```python\nlist_items = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\nfor i in list_items:\n    print(i)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `for` loop iterates over the list of items. For each iteration, the current item (`i`) is printed.\n\nYou can also specify a starting point and an ending point for the loop. Here's an example with a start and end point:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(3, 6):\n    print(i)\n```\n\nThis will print the numbers 3, 4, and 5. The `range()` function's stop value is exclusive, meaning it does not include the final value.\n\nHere is an example with a `while` loop:\n\n```python\ni = 0\nwhile i < 5:\n    print(i)\n    i += 1\n```\n\nThis will also print the numbers 0 to 4, but it will stop after the first iteration. The `while` loop continues until `i` is no longer less than 5."

The `for` loop then iterates over this sequence, and for each iteration `i` takes the value from `range` (which is an integer).\n\nThe statement `print(i)` inside the loop is what prints the current value of `i`.\n\nThis is a basic example of a loop in Python. You can replace the `print` statement with any operation you want to perform for each iteration."

Inside the loop, we first print the current value of `i`, then increment `i` by 1 (`i += 1`).\n\nThe loop will continue until `i` is no longer less than or equal to 10, at which point the loop ends.\n\nThis is a basic example of a loop in Python.

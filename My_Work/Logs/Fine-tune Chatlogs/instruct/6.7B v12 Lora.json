            "Explanation:\nA for loop is a control structure that allows you to iterate over a sequence of items, such as a list or string, and perform an action for each item. The basic syntax of a for loop is as follows:\n```\nfor variable in sequence:\n    # code to execute for each item in the sequence\n```\nIn this example, `variable` is a temporary variable that holds the current item in the sequence, and `sequence` is the list or string that you want to iterate over. The code inside the for loop will be executed once for each item in the sequence.\n\nFor example, if you have a list of numbers and you want to print each number, you could use a for loop like this:\n```\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor number in numbers:\n    print(number)\n```\nThis will print the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nIncorrect Code:\nHere is an incorrect version of the for loop that does not follow the correct syntax:\n```\nfor variable in sequence:\n    # code to execute for each item in the sequence\n```\nThis code will not work because the variable name `variable` is not defined in the for loop. The correct syntax for a for loop is as follows:\n```\nfor variable in sequence:\n    # code to execute for each item in the sequence\n```\nSpot the problem in the code:\nCan you spot the problem in the incorrect code? <|endoftext|>"

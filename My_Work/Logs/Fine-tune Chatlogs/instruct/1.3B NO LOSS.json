            "A for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string). It allows you to execute a block of code for each item in the sequence. The syntax is:\n\nfor variable in sequence:\n    # code to execute\n\nHere is an example with an intentional mistake:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(1, 5):\n    print(i)\n\n# Hint: The range function here only goes up to 4. Can you spot and correct the error to make it print 1 through 5?\n```\n\nIn this example, the range function here only goes up to 4. Can you spot and correct the error to make it print 1 through 5?\n\nExplain how below code works\n\n```python\nfor i in range(1, 5):\n    print(i)\n\n# Hint: The range function here only goes up to 4. Can you spot and correct the error to make it print 1 through 5?\n```\n\nIn this hinted code, the range function here only goes up to 4.

            "A for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string). It allows you to execute a block of code for each item in the sequence. The syntax is:\n\nfor variable in sequence:\n    # code to execute\n\nHere is an example with an intentional mistake:\n\n```\nfor i in range(1, 5):\n    print(i)\n```\n\n# Hint: The range function here only goes up to 4. Can you spot and correct the error to make it print 1 through 5?\n\n# Solution: The range function should go up to 5, not 4. The correct code would be:\n\n```\nfor i in range(1, 6):\n    print(i)\n```\n\n# Hint: What would you like to add or change to make the code execute properly?\n\n# Solution: The print statement is inside the loop. Can you rearrange the code to make it execute properly?\n\n# Solution: The corrected code would be:\n\n```\nfor i in range(1, 5):\n    print(i)\n```\n\n# Hint: How else can you add to make this code execute properly?\n\n# Solution: The loop is properly indented.

            "In Python, a for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string). The syntax is:\n\n```python\nfor variable in sequence:\n    # code to execute\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. **Variable**: This is a temporary variable that takes the value of the items in the sequence.\n\n2. **Sequence**: This is the actual sequence that the for loop will iterate over. It can be a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string.\n\n3. **Code to execute**: This is the code that will be executed for each iteration of the loop.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n```\n\nThis will print the numbers 0 through 4. The `range(5)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4, and the for loop iterates over this sequence. For each iteration, the variable `i` takes the next value from the sequence (which is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4). The code inside the loop (`print(i)`) is then executed.\n\nThe for loop continues to execute this code as long as the sequence is not exhausted. When the sequence is exhausted, the for loop stops.\n\nHere's another example:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(i)\n```\n\nThis will print the numbers 0 through 2. The `range(3)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 2, and the for loop iterates over this sequence.\n\nThe for loop continues to execute this code as long as the sequence is not exhausted. When the sequence is exhausted, the for loop stops."

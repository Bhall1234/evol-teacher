            "Explanation:\nThe question is asking you to create a for loop in Python to print out the items in a list of fruits. The list contains four fruits: apple, banana, cherry, and orange.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\"]\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\n```\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem in the code? What is missing or incorrect?\n\nSpot the Problem:\nThe code is correct, but it does not print out the items in the list. Instead, it prints out the variable `fruit`. To fix this, you need to print the value of `fruit` instead of the variable itself.\n\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem in the code?

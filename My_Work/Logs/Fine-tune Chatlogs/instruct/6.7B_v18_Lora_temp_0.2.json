            "Variables in Python are used to store data. They are essentially containers that hold information. The data stored in a variable can be of any type, such as integers, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.\n\nIn Python, you can create a variable by using the assignment operator (=). Here's an example:\n\n```python\nx = 10\n```\n\nIn this example, `x` is a variable that holds the integer `10`. You can use the variable `x` later in your code to refer to the data it holds.\n\nHere's another example:\n\n```python\nname = \"Alice\"\n```\n\nIn this example, `name` is a variable that holds the string `\"Alice\"`.\n\nYou can also use the `type()` function in Python to check the type of a variable:\n\n```python\nprint(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>\nprint(type(name))  # Output: <class 'str'>\n```\n\nIn this example, `type(x)` returns the type of the data stored in `x`"

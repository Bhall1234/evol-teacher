        "answer": "Explanation:\nThe question asks for a Python function to find the factorial of a given positive integer using real-world context. The factorial of a number is the product of that number and all the numbers before it, excluding zero. For example, the factorial of 5 is 120 (5!).\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```python\ndef find_factorial(n):\n    result = n * (n - 1)\n    return result\n```\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem in the code?"

        "answer": "Explanation:\nThe modulo operator (%) is a useful tool for calculating the remainder of a division operation. In this question, we want to determine if a given number is even or odd by using the modulo operator. The idea behind this is that if a number divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 0, then it is even. If a number divided by 2 leaves a non-zero remainder, then it is odd.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```python\ndef is_even(n):\n    return n % 2 == 0\n```\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem in this code?"

        "instruction": "Sorting a list of integers in descending order can be achieved using the built-in `sorted()` function with the `reverse` argument set to `True`. Here's an example:\n```python\nnumbers = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]\nsorted_descending = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)\nprint(sorted_descending) # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n```",
        "answer": "Explanation:\nThe `sorted()` function can be used to sort a list of integers in ascending order by default. However, if we want to sort the list in descending order, we need to set the `reverse` argument to `True`. This tells Python to reverse the sorting order, so that the largest numbers come first instead of the smallest ones.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```python\nnumbers = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]\nsorted_descending = sorted(numbers, reverse=False)\nprint(sorted_descending) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem in the code?"

        "answer": "Explanation:\nThe `float()` function converts a string representation of a float into an actual float value. In this case, the string `\"3.14\"` can be converted to a float value of `3.14`.

The correct way to use the `float()` function would be like this:\n```\nmy_string = \"3.14\"\nmy_float = float(my_string) # output: 3.14\n```\nPrompt:\nCan you spot the problem in the code?

        "answer": "Explanation:\nIn Python, a custom exception is a way for a programmer to define their own types of exceptions that can be raised and handled in the code. This allows for more specific and meaningful error messages, as well as improved readability and maintainability of the code. To create a custom exception in Python, you need to define a new class that inherits from the `Exception` class, and then raise it using the `raise` statement.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```\nclass MyCustomException(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, message):\n        self.message = message\n        super().__init__(message)\n\ntry:\n    raise MyCustomException(\"This is a custom exception\")\nexcept:\n    print(\"Caught the custom exception!\")\n```\nPrompt:\nSpot the problem in the code.

In this case, we want to print out the items in the list.\n\nIncorrect Code:\n```\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\"]\nfor fruit in fruits:\n  print(fruit)\n```\nThis code is incorrect because it does not actually print out each item in the list.

        "instruction": "Calculate the Total Cost of Insurance Premiums\n\nAs an insurance agent, you need to calculate the total cost of premiums for a customer's policy. Write a Python function named `total_premium` that takes two arguments: `base_rate` (a float) and `years` (an integer). The function should use a loop to multiply the base rate by the number of years. For example, if the base rate is 100 and the number of years is 3, the output would be the product of the base rate and the number of years.\n\nExample:\n```\nbase_rate = 100\nyears = 3\n\ntotal_premium(base_rate, years)\n```\nNote: The `total_premium` function should return the calculated total cost.",

You want to send them a text message with the numbers of the tables where they'll be seated in descending order (so the tallest friend gets the biggest table). Create a list of these table numbers in descending order using Python. For example, if your list contains the numbers [4, 2, 9, 7, 1], how can you arrange them so that the largest number comes first and the smallest number comes last?\n\n(Note: Focus on common beginner topics like loops, conditionals, functions, and list operations to solve this task.)",

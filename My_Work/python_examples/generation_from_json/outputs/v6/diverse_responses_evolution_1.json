Create a variable called `number` and assign it to the input number from the user.\n2. Use the modulo operator `%` to check if the number is divisible by 2, i.e., `(number % 2) == 0`. If this condition is true, then the number is even. Otherwise, it is odd.\n3. Print out \"even\" or \"odd\" depending on whether the number is even or odd."
